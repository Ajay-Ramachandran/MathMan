This was made in the begining of 2015 as a quick group project for math class. This does **not** represent my current programming skills, or even my skills at the time. This was my first group programming project. This is here for historical purposes only.

# MathMan
A pacman clone where you try to get the highest amount of points. When you eat a number, you score is either multiplied, divided, subtracted, or added to the number you ate depending on the operation in the top left corner. If you die, you have to do a quick quiz for a revive based on doing math with negative and positive numbers

This is the source. It's not pretty, but here it is.
